    <h3><u>PROJECTS</u></h3>
    <h3><u> CHARACTERISATION ON MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF HYBRID COMPOSITES</u></h3>
    <p><ul><li>This project aims an attempt to replace basalt fiber with glass fiber. The milled glass powder is used as a filler material. Various tests were performed to study the mechanical character of the basalt/epoxy composite materials infused with filler materials. The result shows improvement in their mechanical property. The test specimens were prepared as per ASTM standards, after conducting both Tensile and Fatigue tests and the results were found to be the composition of basalt and glass fiber turns out to be a failure as it can’t withstand high load under stress.</li></ul></p>
